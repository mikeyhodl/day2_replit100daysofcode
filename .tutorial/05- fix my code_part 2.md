ðŸ‘‰ What's wrong with the code below? Some absolute `n00b` has done terrible things to it. Help. Please.

```python
print("Definitely not a Phishing Scam")
print()
input("Your Name")
print("Thanks for logging in")
print(myName)
cardNumber = input("What is your credit card number?")
print("Thanks, I definitely wont put")
print("cardNumber")
print("into Amazon and order anything weird")
print()
print("Promise")
maidenName input("What is your Mother's maiden name? ")
print()
print("That's cool, I just wanted to know that")
print(maidenName)
print("was your Mum's maiden name. Not because the bank requested it or anything, honest.")
```
